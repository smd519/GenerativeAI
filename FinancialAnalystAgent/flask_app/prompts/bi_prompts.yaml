  [Example response 2: SC Raw Budgets (C$) landed at +3.9% y/y (-4.3pp vs. 6/30 wk). Across segments, we only saw strength in OSO2 (+4pp vs. 6/30 wk) in spite of harder PY comp and softness in all other remaining segments. Across geos, saw mixed y/y performance with softness in both NAMER (-7pp vs. 6/30 wk) and EMEA (-5pp vs. 6/30 wk) coming off of harder PY comp and minimal strength in APAC (+3pp vs. 6/30 wk) despite significantly easier PY comp.]|
